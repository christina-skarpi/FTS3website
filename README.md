Note to site admins:

The top level directory of your site files is not accessible on purpose,
you may store drupal-related content in subdirectories: /files/ /modules/ and /themes/.

The settings.php file is not accessible either to protect against accidental
exposure of drupal database credentials and to ensure proper hosted service operation.
